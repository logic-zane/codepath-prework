some interesting ideas to build my App:
    Since I like traveling to countries like Japan, I would design a travel itinerary builder to help users plan their trips efficiently. The app will implement many features, first, the user inputs the country or place they desire to travel to. Based on the location, the app will generate a list of tourist attractions (will have a rating on every tourist attraction(Use REST API to gather the rating)). After selecting attractions, the app would provide options for nearby hotels with pricing information. Additionally, it would suggest the best transportation options within the country. To provide the best experience for users, the app would introduce the culture and traditions of the chosen destination at the beginning of the process, helping users learn more about the country before they start planning. It would also generate a list of local restaurants, including recommendations and menu highlights, to ensure users have a full cultural experience while traveling. Finally, the app would allow users to book their return tickets, completing the entire travel planning process. There are lot to include but for now, it will be it. 
     

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One challenge I faced was being unfamiliar with finding certain features, like the 'Attribute Inspector.' However, aside from that, the rest of the issues were manageable and solved.
